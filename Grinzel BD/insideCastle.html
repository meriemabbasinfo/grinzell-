                As you and the knight step through the grand, creaking doors of the ancient castle, a cold gust of wind welcomes you. The air is thick with dust and mystery, every shadow seeming to whisper secrets long forgotten.

The ground beneath yall vanishes in an instant, sending both you and the knight tumbling into a dark, hidden chamber below. Torches along the walls flicker to life, casting an eerie glow over the stone floor. A low growl echoes through the room.
